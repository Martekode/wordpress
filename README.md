this is a site where I worked on for a previous version. A lot has changed sinds then: mainly the styling but certain pages also. I included this sinds I already am capable of working with wordpress and have done so primairily with the elementor plugin. That plugin give a lot of features such as carousels, video imports, many on hover/click/mouseover/etc... and much more are provided in that plugin. it costs money though...    :S

## my take on this task
well i feel a little dissapointed. I understand that this task is aimed towards people where if they want to quickly make a static website with little functionality, they can easily do so. 
_______
For a 100 euro's / dollars I would not even open wordpress to be honoust. A couple of hundred euro's maybe... and then again i would use elementor and not the base wordpress editor. I would honoustly prefer not to waste my time on something ANYONE can do. I came to becode to do better and aim towards projects that would cost thousands. So I render this lesson as useless. Sorry for my frankness but that is how I genuinly feel. Another reasoning that might explain my opinion more clearly is: "In order to make a website for people that they can use for their business (because that is going to me the majority of offers) it has to be dynamic or as dynamic as can be." A business never provides the same things, it keeps evolving. This would essentially render me stuck with wordpress as long as they might use it. I would have to update content, add or delete pages, etc.. Maintenence is still needed, so I would charge more.

I woul have prefered to see the development side instead of just a link to it. It would have shown to power of PHP even though everybody says it's dead. It would have shown ous that that statemnet is WRONG. Because saying that majority of the websites are wordpress and in the same sentence saying PHP is dead, is a huge contredicton. Sinds wordpress runs on php. I looked into the dev documentation instead and got a little bit more knowlege about it. (Maybe a tip)

Hope I gave enough examples to explain myself and also to prove that I already have some experience with wordpress and plugins. cheerio
